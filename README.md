## Using preconfigured development VM (recommended)

### 1. Installing Vagrant

This step assumes that you have installed ruby already.

#### 1.1 Linux and OSX

```bash
$ sudo gem install vagrant 
```

#### 1.2 Windows

Grab the latest vagrant version from the official [download page](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
and install it using the windows msi installer.
